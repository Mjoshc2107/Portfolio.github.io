            <h3>Because I'm<span> Mark Joshua Concepcion</span>.</h3>
            <h3>who studies at Cainta Catholic College and I am a BSCS who wants to expand my knowledge of making websites
                <br> and as much as possible of course with games I am really inclined to go around PC's just that sometimes I also lose <br> 
                I think because sometimes I may not be able to restore it to the previous 
                one or I will break something but I believe <br> 
                that when you do not make mistakes you will not learn. <br> <br>
                I am 20 years old and my birthday is December 11, 2002 and my hobby is playing games and I am a content creator on Twitch, Tiktok, Facebook and Youtube <br>
                I also make songs or rap songs rnb or even acoustic payans. the games I always played are adventure, fps and just a game where it is possible to earn <br>
                and I worked as a waiter before With Pasay City now there is no single focus on learning priorities first and then when you are done gambling again. <br> <br>
